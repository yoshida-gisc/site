# Welcome! {-}

<img src="Forest.png" width="23%" height=auto align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" />**Takahiro Yoshida** (吉田 崇紘) is an Assistant Professor (*Kōshi*) at [Center for Spatial Information Science](https://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), the University of Tokyo, Japan. The foundation of all his research interests is the geographical information science. His more specific interests are: 

(1) spatial data analysis based on spatial statistics, spatial econometrics, and remote sensing, and its combination with compositional data analysis; and 
(2) climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban areas with complex systems of building environments, transport networks, and human behaviors. 

Very welcome you who are interested in either. Very very welcome you who are interested in both. In most cases, it is either. Admission information can be found in a webpage of [Department of Socio-Cultural Environmental Studies, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences](https://sbk.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html).
